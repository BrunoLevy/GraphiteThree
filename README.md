![](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/GraphiteThree/wiki/graphite_banner.gif)

Graphite is an experimental 3D modeler, built around
[geogram](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram). 

It contains the main results in Geometry Processing from the former
ALICE Inria project, that is, more than 30 research articles published
in ACM SIGGRAPH, ACM Transactions on Graphics, Symposium on Geometry 
Processing and Eurographics. It was supported by two grants from the
European Research Council (ERC): GOODSHAPE and VORPALINE.
