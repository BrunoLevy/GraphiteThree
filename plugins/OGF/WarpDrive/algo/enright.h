     *	\brief Implementation of VelocityField for Enright test.
     *	\details from talpa, example tests of elTopo library, cf Tyson
     *	 Brochu and al. 2009.  it was originally proposed by Doug
     *   Enright in 2002: D. Enright, R. Fedkiw, J. Ferziger, and
     *	 I. Mitchell, A hybrid particle level set method for improved
     *	 interface capturing, J. Comput. Phys., 183 (2002), pp. 83â€“116.
     *   Typical test scenario uses a sphere of radius .15 centered 
     *   on (.35,.35,.35). Motion is periodic, with a period of 3s (default).
     *	\note This implementation by David Lopez (June 2010).
