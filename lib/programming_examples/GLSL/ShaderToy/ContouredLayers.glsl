	Contoured Layers
	----------------

	Constructing some concise contoured layers, then applying various edge and shading 
	effects to produce some faux depth. Technically, that's what is happening here, but
	this example was mainly put together as a means to demonstrate various layering
    effects, like strokes, highlights, shadows, etc. No 3D was harmed during the making
	of this example. :)

	I love those contoured noise-based paper layer images that various graphic artists
	from places like Adobe distribute with their applications. Most consist of some
	antialised noise layers rendered in a flat tone with drop shadows for each. The 
	fancier ones sometimes include highlighted edges, etc, which is what I've put 
	together here. None of it is difficult to produce, provided you're happy with
	concept of smoothing layers at a particular threshold with respect to the field
	derivative.

	I put in a few diferent aesthetic options to try, just to show how much something
	like a simple palette change, drop shadow, etc, can effect the overall feel. 
	Anyway, feel free to play around with the defines below. At some stage, I might
    render some icons and allow the various options to be manipulated via the mouse,
	but for now, this will suffice.

	I also have a few raymarched 3D versions that I'll put up at a later date.
