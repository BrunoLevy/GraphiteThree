// This is a procedural pattern that has 2 parameters, that generalizes cell-noise, 
// perlin-noise and voronoi, all of which can be written in terms of the former as:
//
// cellnoise(x) = pattern(0,0,x)
// perlin(x) = pattern(0,1,x)
// voronoi(x) = pattern(1,0,x)
//
// From this generalization of the three famouse patterns, a new one (which I call 
// "Voronoise") emerges naturally. It's like perlin noise a bit, but within a jittered 
// grid like voronoi):
//
// voronoise(x) = pattern(1,1,x)
//
// Not sure what one would use this generalization for, because it's slightly slower 
// than perlin or voronoise (and certainly much slower than cell noise), and in the 
// end as a shading TD you just want one or another depending of the type of visual 
// features you are looking for, I can't see a blending being needed in real life.  
// But well, if only for the math fun it was worth trying. And they say a bit of 
// mathturbation can be healthy anyway!


// Use the mouse to blend between different patterns:

// ell noise    u=0,v=0
// voronoi      u=1,v=0
// perlin noise u=0,v1=
// voronoise    u=1,v=1
