	Alloy Plated Voronoi
	--------------------

    This was originally a rigid scrolling example, but I thought the movement looked more 
	interesting. Obviously, hard, fluid alloy doesn't make a lot of physical sense, so if the 
	situation really messes with your sense of correctness, uncomment the "RIGID_SCOLL" 
	define... or just pretend it's futuristic alien alloy from another dimension. :D

    From a technical perspective, it's a couple of smooth Voronoi layers (based on IQ's
	article below), split into fractional contours then bump mapped. Hardly cutting edge,
    and	not all that exciting. One of the things that did require some effort was producing 
	the succinct smooth borders with enough quality to allow for pronounced bump mapping
	with minimal artifacts. The results are sufficient, but there are probably more efficent 
	ways to achieve the same.

	I was going for a tarnished silver kind of look. Not sure whether it worked, but it looks
	shiny, so that's good enough for me. :) When I first started taking an interest in graphics, 
	my idea of producing a metallic looking object was to render it flat grey, then add some 
	ambient lighting... Yes, I was "that" naive. :D

	These days, I apply a little more science, but a lot of it is still made up. Specular 
	lighting and fake reflections help add to the illusion, but I find that	ramping the diffuse 
	light to a few powers tends to work best. Also, to give the light more angularity, I 
	accentuated the bump mapping more than I usually would.
