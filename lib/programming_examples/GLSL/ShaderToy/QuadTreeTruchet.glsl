	Quadtree Truchet
	----------------

    A multiscale, multitile, overlapped, weaved Truchet pattern -- However, since
	that description is a little verbose, I figured that a quadtree Truchet was as
	good a description as any. :) The mild weave effect is provided via the
	"INCLUDE_LINE_TILES" define.

	In order to produce a varied looking Truchet pattern, there are a couple of
	simple things you can try: One is to use more than one tile, and the other is
	to stitch weaved tiles together to produce a cool under-over effect. There are
    a few examples on Shadertoy of each, which are easy enough to find -- Just do
	a search for "Truchet" and look for the multitile and weaved examples.

    Lesser known variations include using Truchet tiles that overlap one another,
    and stitching together multiscaled tiles -- usually on something like a quadtree
    grid. This example uses elements of all of the aforementioned.

	In the past, I've combined two non-overlapping tile scales, but had never
    considered taking it beyond that... until I came across Christopher Carlson's
	article, "Multi-Scale Truchet Patterns." If you follow the link below and refer
	to the construction process, you'll see that the idea behind it is almost
	rundimentary. As a consequence, I figured that it'd take me five minutes to put
	the ideas into pixel shader form. Unfortunately, they say the dumber you are,
	the more overconfident you'll be, and to cut a long story short... It took me
	longer than five minutes. :D

	The code below is somewhat obfuscated and strewn with defines - The defines are
	my fault, since I wanted to provide a few rendering options. However, the
	remaining complication boils down to the necessity to render overlapping tiles
	on a repeat quadtree grid in an environment that doesn't allow random pixel
	access. The only example along those lines I could find on here was IQ's
	hierachical Voronoi demonstration, which is pretty cool, but I needed to render
	things in a way that involved less nesting, which complicated things.

	Either way, the idea is pretty simple: Construct a grid, randomly render some
	Truchet tiles, subdivide the remaining squares into four, randomly render some
    more tiles in reverse color order, then continue ad infinitum. By the way, I
	constructed this on the fly using the best method I could think of at the time.
	However, if anyone out there has a more elegant solution, feel free to post it. :)
	
	Naturally, the idea can be extended to 3D. Three levels with this particular
	setup might be a little slow. However, two levels using a non overlapping tile
	is definitely doable, so I intend to produce an example along those lines in the
	near future.
