	Hexagonal Maze Flow
	-------------------

	I've been playing around with hexagonal grids lately. It's possible to make all kinds of
	interesting things with them. I'll eventually tire of hexagons and get back to what I'm 
	supposed to be doing, but for now, here's a maze with a flowing polkadot snake-like
	pattern running through it... I'm not really sure what it is either. :)

	It has an impossible geometry feel to it, and is rendered in an oldschool kind of game
	style. It was pretty easy to produce: Obtain some hexagonal grid cell coordinates and 
	corresponding ID, render some lines, shapes, and a few arcs for the Truchet component,
	apply some shading, etc.
	
	It was more of an exercise in applying layers in the right order than anything else. One 
	of the things that might be of interest is the flowing Truchet pattern. Producing a 
	flowing hexagonal Truchet isn't much different to producing a square one. In fact, it's
	easier - in the sense that you don't have to reverse directions from cell to cell. 

	However, one of the downsides is that it's not immediately obvious how to apply UV 
	coordinates - I think BigWings mentioned this, and I concur. :) I got around the problem
	by ensuring that the texture pattern had the appropriate symmetry and applying hybrid 
	polar coordinates. By that, I mean, I wrapped the polar angles across the arc boundaries
	and used that for one coordinate, then used the Truchet distance field itself for the 
	other...

    Roughly speaking, it's not much different to a circle: In that situation, you use the 
	familiar polar coordinates (r = length(u), a = atan(u.y, u.x)). The only difference in 
	this case is that you use a modified radial coordinate (r = min(min(r1, r2), r3)) - or 
	to put it another way, you use the distance field value... It's a bit difficult to 
	explain, but easy to perform. When I get time, I'm going to produce a more robust Truchet 
	texturing example.
